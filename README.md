# mp3rip
This is the latest (and likely final) incarnation of a means to consistently rip CDs to mp3. It's rarely used now (unsurprisingly) but was an excellent learning tool, integrating some interesting last.fm accesses.

Originally a shell script, this evolved into Python because I wanted to embed album art during the ripping process, and mutagen was one of the few ID3 libraries that dealt with album art.

It has given me a great deal of joy over the past few years every time I come to use it or to tinker with it, however that also means it's probably not generic enough for general use and any number of other people have assembled ripping programs that are probably better, more functional and less specific to my environment.
